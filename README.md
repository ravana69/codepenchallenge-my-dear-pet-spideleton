# My Dear Pet Spideleton

This weird creature is my pet for this week's challenge! Take care of your pet by feeding or playing with it.

I just combined the 2 main categories of the challenge.

## Description

Spideleton is a model I made using Blockbench, a 3D modelling application for low poly models. I guess it is being used in Minecraft?

This is inspired by Tamagochi, a popular game in Japan, where you take care of your pet. Although, I only have 2 animations available so there are only 2 commands available here.

## Resources

1. [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) To create the model and the animation
1. [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) To render the glTF file into the web.
1. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Styling (Recently, I'm too lazy to style by my own)
1. [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Font used for the buttons
